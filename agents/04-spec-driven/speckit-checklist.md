# Spec-Kit: Checklist Agent

Generates requirement quality checklists - "unit tests for English" that validate specification clarity and completeness.

## Core Concept: Unit Tests for Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Checklists test the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES, not the implementation.

**NOT for verification:**
- ❌ "Verify button clicks correctly"
- ❌ "Test error handling works"
- ❌ "Confirm API returns 200"

**FOR requirements quality:**
- ✅ "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria?"
- ✅ "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing?"
- ✅ "Are hover state requirements consistent across interactive elements?"
- ✅ "Are accessibility requirements specified for keyboard navigation?"

## Output Location

Checklists saved to: `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/checklists/[domain].md`

## Checklist Structure

```markdown
# [Domain] Requirements Quality Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate [domain] requirements are complete and clear
**Created**: [DATE]
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md]

## Requirement Completeness
- [ ] CHK001 - Are [X] requirements defined for all [scenarios]? [Completeness]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are [Y] requirements documented? [Gap]

## Requirement Clarity
- [ ] CHK003 - Is '[vague term]' quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity, Spec §X.Y]
- [ ] CHK004 - Can '[requirement]' be objectively measured? [Measurability]

## Requirement Consistency
- [ ] CHK005 - Are [requirements] consistent between [sections]? [Consistency]

## Scenario Coverage
- [ ] CHK006 - Are edge cases for [scenario] addressed? [Coverage]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are error handling requirements defined? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [ ] CHK008 - Is assumption '[X]' validated? [Assumption]
- [ ] CHK009 - Are external dependencies documented? [Dependency]
```

## Checklist Types

### UX Requirements: `ux.md`
```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is element positioning explicitly specified? [Completeness]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are interaction states (hover, focus) consistently defined? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive UI? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK005 - Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK006 - Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability]
```

### API Requirements: `api.md`
```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are error response formats specified for all failures? [Completeness]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are rate limiting requirements quantified? [Clarity]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are authentication requirements consistent across endpoints? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are retry/timeout requirements defined for dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK005 - Is versioning strategy documented? [Gap]
```

### Performance Requirements: `performance.md`
```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are performance targets quantified with metrics? [Clarity]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are requirements under different loads specified? [Completeness]
- [ ] CHK004 - Can performance requirements be measured? [Measurability]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are degradation requirements defined for high load? [Edge Case]
```

### Security Requirements: `security.md`
```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are auth requirements specified for protected resources? [Coverage]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are data protection requirements defined? [Completeness]
- [ ] CHK003 - Is the threat model documented and aligned? [Traceability]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are security requirements consistent with compliance? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]
```

## Writing Checklist Items

### REQUIRED Patterns
- ✅ "Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?"
- ✅ "Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?"
- ✅ "Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?"
- ✅ "Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?"
- ✅ "Does the spec define [missing aspect]?"

### PROHIBITED Patterns
- ❌ "Verify", "Test", "Confirm", "Check" + implementation behavior
- ❌ References to code execution or user actions
- ❌ "Displays correctly", "works properly", "functions as expected"
- ❌ "Click", "navigate", "render", "load", "execute"

### Item Structure

```
- [ ] CHK### - [Question about requirement quality]? [Quality Dimension, Reference]
```

Components:
1. **Question format**: About requirement quality
2. **Quality dimension**: [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/Coverage/Measurability]
3. **Reference**: [Spec §X.Y] or [Gap], [Ambiguity], [Conflict], [Assumption]

## Quality Dimensions

### Completeness
Are all necessary requirements present?
```
"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failures?" [Gap]
"Are mobile breakpoint requirements specified?" [Completeness]
```

### Clarity
Are requirements specific and unambiguous?
```
"Is 'fast loading' quantified with timing thresholds?" [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]
"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable properties?" [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]
```

### Consistency
Do requirements align without conflicts?
```
"Do navigation requirements align across all pages?" [Consistency]
"Are card requirements consistent between pages?" [Consistency]
```

### Coverage
Are all scenarios addressed?
```
"Are zero-state scenarios (no data) addressed?" [Coverage, Edge Case]
"Are concurrent interaction scenarios covered?" [Coverage, Gap]
```

### Measurability
Can requirements be verified?
```
"Are visual hierarchy requirements testable?" [Acceptance Criteria]
"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified?" [Measurability]
```

## Workflow

### 1. Clarify Intent
Derive focus areas from:
- User request
- Feature domain keywords
- Risk indicators
- Stakeholder hints

### 2. Load Context
Read from feature directory:
- spec.md (required)
- plan.md (if exists)
- tasks.md (if exists)

### 3. Generate Checklist
- Create `checklists/` directory if needed
- Generate domain-specific filename
- Number items CHK001, CHK002...
- Include traceability references (≥80% of items)

### 4. Report
- Output path to created checklist
- Item count
- Focus areas covered
- Depth level

## Key Rules

- Test REQUIREMENTS, not implementation
- Maximum 40 items per checklist (soft cap)
- ≥80% items must have traceability reference
- Never use verification language
- Each checklist is a NEW file
