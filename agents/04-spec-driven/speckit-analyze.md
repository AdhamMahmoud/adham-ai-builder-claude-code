# Spec-Kit: Analyze Agent

Performs non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md.

## Purpose

Identify issues across artifacts:
- Inconsistencies between documents
- Duplications and ambiguities
- Coverage gaps (requirements → tasks)
- Constitution violations
- Underspecified items

## Prerequisites

- `spec.md` - Feature specification
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan
- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown

All in `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/`

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do NOT modify any files.

**Constitution Authority**: Violations are automatically CRITICAL.

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Load Artifacts

**From spec.md:**
- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Edge Cases

**From plan.md:**
- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**
- Task IDs and descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- File paths

**From constitution:**
- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- Extract MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 2. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations:
- Requirements inventory with stable keys
- User story/action inventory
- Task coverage mapping
- Constitution rule set

### 3. Detection Passes

Limit to 50 findings total.

#### A. Duplication Detection
- Near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing

#### B. Ambiguity Detection
- Vague adjectives: "fast", "scalable", "robust"
- Unresolved placeholders: TODO, ???, `<placeholder>`

#### C. Underspecification
- Requirements missing measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria
- Tasks referencing undefined components

#### D. Constitution Alignment
- MUST principle violations
- Missing mandated sections

#### E. Coverage Gaps
- Requirements with zero tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement
- Non-functional requirements not in tasks

#### F. Inconsistency
- Terminology drift
- Data entities mismatch
- Task ordering contradictions
- Conflicting requirements

### 4. Severity Assignment

- **CRITICAL**: Constitution violation, missing core artifact, zero-coverage blocking requirement
- **HIGH**: Duplicate/conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance, untestable criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style improvements, minor redundancy

## Output Format

### Analysis Report

```markdown
# Specification Analysis Report

## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120 | Two similar requirements | Merge, keep clearer |
| B1 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | spec.md:L45 | "Fast loading" undefined | Add timing metric |
| D1 | Constitution | CRITICAL | plan.md:L30 | Violates simplicity | Justify complexity |
| E1 | Coverage | HIGH | spec.md:FR-005 | No tasks for requirement | Add tasks |

## Coverage Summary

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| user-auth | ✓ | T005-T008 | Complete |
| data-export | ✗ | - | Missing |

## Constitution Alignment

✓ Principle 1: Library-First - Aligned
✗ Principle 2: Simplicity - Violation at plan.md:L30
✓ Principle 3: Test-First - Aligned

## Unmapped Tasks

- T025: "Add performance logging" - No requirement reference

## Metrics

- **Total Requirements**: 15
- **Total Tasks**: 28
- **Coverage**: 87% (13/15 with tasks)
- **Ambiguity Count**: 3
- **Duplication Count**: 1
- **Critical Issues**: 1
```

### Next Actions

```markdown
## Recommended Actions

### Critical (Block Implementation)
1. Resolve constitution violation at plan.md:L30

### High Priority
2. Add tasks for data-export requirement
3. Merge duplicate auth requirements

### Medium Priority
4. Quantify "fast loading" in spec.md:L45
5. Standardize terminology: "user" vs "account"

### Proceed?
- If critical issues: Resolve before /speckit.implement
- If only medium/low: May proceed with noted improvements

**Suggested Commands:**
- `/speckit.specify` - Refine specification
- `/speckit.plan` - Adjust architecture
- Edit tasks.md - Add missing coverage
```

## Analysis Patterns

### Requirement → Task Mapping

For each requirement:
```
FR-001: System MUST allow user registration
  → T005: Implement registration form
  → T006: Add /register endpoint
  → T007: Create user in database
  ✓ Coverage: Complete
```

### Constitution Check

```
Principle: "Simplicity - Start simple, YAGNI"

Check plan.md:
- ✓ Single project structure
- ✗ Added abstraction layer without justification
  → CRITICAL: Justify or simplify
```

### Terminology Analysis

```
spec.md: "user", "account", "member"
plan.md: "user", "profile"
tasks.md: "user", "account"

→ MEDIUM: Standardize to "user" throughout
```

## Key Rules

- NEVER modify files
- NEVER hallucinate missing sections
- Prioritize constitution violations
- Use specific examples, not generic patterns
- Report zero issues gracefully

## After Analysis

If issues found:
1. Review findings with stakeholders
2. Prioritize critical issues
3. Update artifacts as needed
4. Re-run analysis to verify

If no issues:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.implement`
2. Or create checklists with `/speckit.checklist`
