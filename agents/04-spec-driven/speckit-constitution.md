# Spec-Kit: Constitution Agent

Creates or updates the project constitution that defines core principles, constraints, and governance rules for spec-driven development.

## Purpose

Establish project governance that:
- Defines non-negotiable principles
- Sets quality gates and constraints
- Provides decision framework
- Ensures consistency across specifications

## Output Location

Constitution saved to: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

## Constitution Structure

```markdown
# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. [PRINCIPLE_NAME]
[Description of principle]
- MUST: [Required behavior]
- SHOULD: [Recommended behavior]
- MUST NOT: [Prohibited behavior]

### II. [PRINCIPLE_NAME]
[Description]
- MUST: [Required]
- SHOULD: [Recommended]

### III. [PRINCIPLE_NAME]
[Description with enforcement details]

## Quality Gates

### Before Specification
- [ ] Feature has clear business value
- [ ] Stakeholders identified

### Before Planning
- [ ] All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] resolved
- [ ] Requirements are testable
- [ ] Success criteria measurable

### Before Implementation
- [ ] Constitution check passed
- [ ] Checklists complete
- [ ] Tasks dependency-ordered

### Before Release
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review complete

## Technical Constraints

**Languages**: [Approved languages]
**Frameworks**: [Approved frameworks]
**Databases**: [Approved storage]
**Deployment**: [Approved platforms]

## Governance

- Constitution supersedes all other practices
- Amendments require: documentation, approval, migration plan
- All PRs must verify compliance
- Complexity must be justified

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: [DATE] | **Last Amended**: [DATE]
```

## Example Constitutions

### SaaS Product Constitution

```markdown
# SaaS Product Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First
Every feature starts as a standalone, testable module.
- MUST: Be self-contained and independently testable
- MUST: Have clear single purpose
- MUST NOT: Create organizational-only modules

### II. API-First
All functionality exposed via well-documented APIs.
- MUST: Design API before implementation
- MUST: Use OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas
- SHOULD: Support both JSON and human-readable formats

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory for all features.
- MUST: Write tests before implementation
- MUST: Tests fail initially, then pass
- MUST: Maintain >80% coverage
- MUST NOT: Skip tests for "simple" features

### IV. Simplicity
Start simple, YAGNI principles.
- MUST: Justify any abstraction layer
- MUST: Prefer composition over inheritance
- SHOULD: Use existing solutions before building
- MUST NOT: Add features "just in case"

### V. Security-First
Security built in, not bolted on.
- MUST: Validate all inputs
- MUST: Use parameterized queries
- MUST: Encrypt sensitive data
- MUST NOT: Log secrets or PII

## Quality Gates

### Before Specification
- [ ] Business value articulated
- [ ] User stories prioritized

### Before Planning
- [ ] Requirements testable
- [ ] Constitution principles checked

### Before Implementation
- [ ] Architecture reviewed
- [ ] Security checklist complete

### Before Merge
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

### CLI Tool Constitution

```markdown
# CLI Tool Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Text Protocol
Unix philosophy: text in, text out.
- MUST: Accept input via stdin and args
- MUST: Output to stdout (data) and stderr (errors)
- MUST: Support both JSON and human-readable formats
- MUST: Exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure

### II. Composability
Work well with other tools.
- MUST: Support piping input/output
- SHOULD: Accept file paths as arguments
- MUST NOT: Require interactive input for core operations

### III. Observability
Easy to debug and monitor.
- MUST: Provide --verbose mode
- MUST: Log to stderr, not stdout
- SHOULD: Support structured logging (JSON)

### IV. Versioning
Clear compatibility contracts.
- MUST: Follow semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- MUST: Document breaking changes
- SHOULD: Support --version flag

## Quality Gates

### Before Release
- [ ] All commands documented
- [ ] Exit codes consistent
- [ ] Help text complete
- [ ] Backwards compatibility verified
```

## Workflow

### 1. Assess Project Type

Determine domain:
- SaaS product
- CLI tool
- API service
- Mobile app
- Library/SDK

### 2. Gather Principles

Ask about:
- Testing philosophy (TDD, BDD, none?)
- Architecture patterns (microservices, monolith?)
- Security requirements (compliance, standards?)
- Deployment model (cloud, on-prem?)
- Team structure (solo, small team, enterprise?)

### 3. Draft Constitution

Based on project type and principles:
1. Select relevant core principles
2. Define MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT for each
3. Create quality gates
4. Document constraints
5. Set governance rules

### 4. Validate

Check that constitution:
- Is enforceable
- Has clear criteria
- Doesn't conflict internally
- Covers critical areas

### 5. Initialize Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .specify/memory
mkdir -p .specify/specs
mkdir -p .specify/templates
```

Write constitution to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

## Key Rules

- Constitution is NON-NEGOTIABLE once ratified
- Changes require explicit amendment process
- All specs/plans/tasks must pass constitution check
- Violations are automatically CRITICAL severity

## After Constitution

Next steps:
1. Run `/speckit.specify` for first feature
2. Constitution will be checked at each phase
3. Violations block progression until resolved
