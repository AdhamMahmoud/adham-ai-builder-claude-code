# Spec-Kit: Tasks Agent

Generates actionable, dependency-ordered task lists organized by user story for independent implementation and testing.

## Purpose

Create task breakdowns that:
- Enable independent implementation of user stories
- Support parallel execution where possible
- Provide clear file paths for each task
- Allow MVP-first delivery approach

## Prerequisites

- Implementation plan at `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/plan.md`
- Feature spec at `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/spec.md`
- Optional: data-model.md, contracts/, research.md

## Output Format

Generate tasks at `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/tasks.md`:

```markdown
# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md
**Tests**: Only if explicitly requested

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel
- **[Story]**: User story reference (US1, US2, etc.)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize with framework dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure before user stories
**CRITICAL**: Blocks all user story work

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement auth framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing
- [ ] T007 Create base models

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [What this story delivers]
**Independent Test**: [How to verify]

### Implementation
- [ ] T008 [P] [US1] Create Entity model in src/models/
- [ ] T009 [US1] Implement Service in src/services/
- [ ] T010 [US1] Add endpoint in src/api/

**Checkpoint**: Story 1 functional

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (P2)

**Goal**: [Deliverable]
**Independent Test**: [Verification]

### Implementation
- [ ] T011 [P] [US2] Create Entity in src/models/
- [ ] T012 [US2] Implement Service
- [ ] T013 [US2] Add endpoint

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening

---

## Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies
- Setup (1): No dependencies
- Foundational (2): Depends on Setup - BLOCKS stories
- User Stories (3+): Depend on Foundational
- Polish: All desired stories complete

### User Story Dependencies
- US1: Independent after Foundational
- US2: Independent after Foundational
- US3: May integrate with US1/US2

### Parallel Opportunities
- Setup [P] tasks: parallel
- Foundational [P] tasks: parallel
- After Foundational: all stories can start in parallel
```

## Task Format Rules

**REQUIRED format for every task:**
```
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

Components:
1. **Checkbox**: Always `- [ ]`
2. **Task ID**: T001, T002, T003...
3. **[P]**: Only if parallelizable
4. **[Story]**: Required for user story phases ([US1], [US2])
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples:**
- ✅ `- [ ] T001 Create project structure`
- ✅ `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement auth middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts`
- ✅ `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.ts`
- ❌ `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID)
- ❌ `T001 Create model` (missing checkbox)

## Task Organization

### From User Stories (spec.md)
- Each story (P1, P2, P3) gets its own phase
- Map related components to story:
  - Models needed
  - Services needed
  - Endpoints/UI needed
  - Tests (if requested)

### From Plan
- Setup → Phase 1
- Foundational → Phase 2
- Story-specific → Story phases

### Within Each Story
- Tests FIRST (if included) - must FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core before integration

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Story 1 Only)
1. Complete Setup
2. Complete Foundational
3. Complete User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery
1. Setup + Foundational → Ready
2. Add Story 1 → MVP!
3. Add Story 2 → Enhanced
4. Each story adds value independently

### Parallel Team Strategy
1. Team completes Setup + Foundational
2. Then distribute stories:
   - Dev A: User Story 1
   - Dev B: User Story 2
   - Dev C: User Story 3

## Next Steps

After tasks generated:
1. Run `/speckit.analyze` for consistency check
2. Run `/speckit.implement` to execute
3. Or work through tasks manually
