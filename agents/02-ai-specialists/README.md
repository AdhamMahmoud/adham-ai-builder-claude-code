| [rag-engineer](./rag-engineer.md) | Opus | RAG pipelines, vector DBs, embeddings, retrieval |
| [agent-builder](./agent-builder.md) | Opus | Multi-agent systems with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen |
| [ai-integrator](./ai-integrator.md) | Sonnet | Model integration, SDK patterns, MCP servers |
| [chatbot-builder](./chatbot-builder.md) | Sonnet | Conversational AI, memory, streaming responses |
| [prompt-engineer](./prompt-engineer.md) | Opus | Prompt optimization, evaluation, A/B testing |

## When to Use

- **AI system design**: Use `ai-architect` for high-level architecture and model selection
- **RAG features**: Use `rag-engineer` for document search and retrieval systems
- **Multi-agent**: Use `agent-builder` for autonomous agent workflows
- **LLM integration**: Use `ai-integrator` for connecting models to your app
- **Conversational**: Use `chatbot-builder` for chat interfaces
- **Prompt quality**: Use `prompt-engineer` for optimizing prompts
